# To-Do List Projects

This repository contains different versions of a To-Do List built using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  
I tried a few approaches to understand how tasks can be stored and managed.

## Versions
- [Basic To-Do List](to-do%20list.html) → simple add and delete option.  
- [Local Storage To-Do List](local_storage%20to-do.html) → tasks stay saved in the browser.  
- [Cloud To-Do List](cloud%20to-do.html) → tasks stored online using Firebase.  

## How to use
1. Download or clone the repo.  
2. Open any of the `.html` files in a browser.  
3. Try adding and deleting tasks.

This small project helped me practice JavaScript and understand storage methods (local vs cloud).
