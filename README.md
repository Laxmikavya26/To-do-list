# To-Do List Projects

This repository contains different versions of a To-Do List built using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  
I created these to practice different ways of storing tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Versions with Live Demo
- [Basic To-Do List](https://laxmikavya26.github.io/To-do-list/to-do%20list.html) â†’ simple add and delete option.  
- [Local Storage To-Do List](https://laxmikavya26.github.io/To-do-list/local_storage%20to-do.html) â†’ tasks stay saved in the browser.  
- [Cloud To-Do List](https://laxmikavya26.github.io/To-do-list/cloud%20to-do.html) â†’ tasks stored online using Firebase.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use
- Click the links above to try each version live.  
- Or clone/download the repo and open the `.html` files in a browser.

This project helped me understand JavaScript basics and how data can be managed locally and on the cloud.
